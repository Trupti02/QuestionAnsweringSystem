# Question Answering System

This project implements a Question Answering System using deep learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP). The system takes as input a context (a paragraph of text) and a question related 
to that context, and it outputs the answer to the question based.

## Overview

The Question Answering System is built using TensorFlow/Keras and Python. It employs a Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanisms to extract relevant information from the context and question, and 
then predicts the answer.
